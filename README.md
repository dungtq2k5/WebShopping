This mini-project was created to enhance my familiarity with Python's Django framework. Inspired by freeCodeCamp, I developed an e-market that allows users to shop in a simplified manner, similar to Shopee, Lazada, and Tiki. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into this powerful framework, which further fueled my passion for back-end development.
The project took approximately two weeks to complete, including both the tutorial and my independent work. During the development process, I experienced a range of emotions, from frustration at encountering roadblocks to elation at overcoming challenges. Ultimately, I was thrilled to publish this project, even though it is not perfect. I am proud of my accomplishment and grateful to freeCodeCamp for providing an excellent tutorial for people like me who can learn and improve more and more about coding and programming.
Thank you for taking the time to read.
