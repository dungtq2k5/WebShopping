This mini-project was created to enhance my familiarity with Python's Django framework. Inspired by freeCodeCamp, I developed an e-market that allows users to shop in a simplified manner, similar to Shopee, Lazada, and Tiki. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into this powerful framework, which further fueled my passion for back-end development.
The project took approximately two weeks to complete, including both the tutorial and my independent work. During the development process, I experienced a range of emotions, from frustration at encountering roadblocks to elation at overcoming challenges. Ultimately, I was so happy to publish this project to you, even though it is not the most perfect but I am proud of my accomplishment and grateful to freeCodeCamp for providing an excellent tutorial for people like me who can learn and improve more and more about coding and programming.
